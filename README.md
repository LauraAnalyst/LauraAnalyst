As a business analyst with 8+ years of experience in analyzing and interpreting complex data, I am currently pursuing a master's degree in data science and analytics to enhance my skills and pursue my passion for using data.

Throughout my professional journey as a business analyst, I have honed my expertise in data analysis, modeling, and visualization. I have also cultivated strong communication and problem-solving skills, which I believe will be valuable in a data science role.

My coursework in statistical modeling and data visualization, utilizing programming languages such as Python and R, has further enriched my skill set and deepened my knowledge of the field. I am enthusiastic about applying my expertise and knowledge to a position in data science and analytics, where I can leverage data to fuel innovation and tackle intricate challenges. By utilizing my proficiency in data analysis, modeling, and effective communication, I aim to drive meaningful insights and assist businesses in making data-driven decisions.
